Library Management System
==========================
This provides a simple Library Management System that allows users to manage books, e-books,
and members within a library.

Features:
- Add, update, remove, and display books and members.
- Borrow and return books with transaction tracking.
- Search books by title or author.
- Display transaction history of members.
- Console-based user interface for interaction.
